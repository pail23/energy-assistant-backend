Energy Assistant is a free, opensource Energy Management System which interfaces with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [Evcc](https://evcc.io/). Home Assistant is a pre-requisit to run Energy Assistant. Evcc is optional. In order to use evcc, the [Evcc Homeassistant component](https://github.com/marq24/ha-evcc) is mandatory to be installed in Home Assistant.

Energy Assistant is using [Emhass](https://emhass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in order to optimize the energy consumption of your house.
